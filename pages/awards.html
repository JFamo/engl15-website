            <h1>Awards</h1>

            <p>Boyertown TSA is one of the nation's highest-performing chapters in competition and was the most involved in 2019. Students and teachers at Boyertown are setting records and receiving praise at the national level for their ambitious program of work and dedication to the organization.</p>

            <h3>LEAP Legacy Chapter</h3>

            <p>The LEAP Legacy Chapter program is the competition at the national level where chapters can submit a summary of their activities throughout the year. Of the more than 250,000 student members worldwide, one chapter is awarded $1,000 and a trophy in recognition of their exceptional efforts. There are five criteria for evaluating this award as follows:</p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Model the Way - Serve as role models for other chapters and students</li>
              <li>Encourage the Heart - Inspire passion and develop group morals</li>
              <li>Challenge the Process - Innovate and advance chapter functions</li>
              <li>Inspire a Shared Vision - Work with a common goal in mind</li>
              <li>Enable Others - Help others contribute to a shared vision</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>After submitting a hundred page portfolio and semifinalizing, BASH TSA was given the opportunity to create a display at the national conference in competition against 9 other semifinalist chapters from 9 other states. Boyertown was eventually selected as the winner of the 2019 LEAP Legacy Chapter award as the outstanding TSA chapter in the world.</p>

            <h3>ACS Donation Record</h3>

            <p>The American Cancer Society (ACS) is TSA's national service project partner. This means that fundraising for the ACS is a major part of TSA and the work of chapters. In 2019, Boyertown TSA set the record for largest single-year ACS donation in TSA history at $11,000. For this donation, the ACS representatives for the northeast came to BASH to recognize the chapter's student officer team. BASH TSA was also given special recognition at the national conference for our charity work and unprecedented donation.</p>

            <h3>Purple Award</h3>

            <p>While BASH TSA set the donation record in 2019, we have been a key player in raising funds for the ACS over the past few years. At the national conference there are three tiers of awards for TSA chapters recognizing their level of donation and these awards are presented during the opening session of the conference. In 2017-2019, BASH TSA has been one of seven chapters to receive the purple award each year. The purple award recognizes chapters donating more than $2,000 to the ACS. Consistent fundraising efforts and dedication to charity fundraising has helped BASH win this award year after year.</p>

            <h3>Pennsylvania Inspiration Award</h3>

            <p>The Inspiration Award is a program at the state level for chapters to showcase their involvement in their school and community throughout the year. Semifinalists are selected upon submission of a portfolio in February while the winner is determined based on an interview at the state conference. BASH TSA entered and lost in 2016, invoking the dedication that eventually drove the chapter to win the award in both 2017 and 2019, becoming the second chapter to win the award multiple times.</p>

            <h3>Region 9 Inspiration Award</h3>

            <p>Similarly to the award at the state conference, region 9 established an award to recognize the strongest chapter in the region. This award has been offered since 2017 and BASH TSA has received it each year.</p>

Will Sheeler from Boyertown received the Clark Grant scholarship in 2017, given to one of five semifinalists after an interview at the state conference. The Outstanding Technology Student award is offered to one male and one female at the state conference each year for outstanding achievement in technology education and in TSA. In 2019, Joshua Famous of Boyertown received this award and its scholarship.</p>
