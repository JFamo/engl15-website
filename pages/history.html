            <h1>History</h1>

            <p>In 1988, the Industrial Arts Student Association became the national Technology Student Association. Just one year later, Boyertown TSA was established and has continued to cultivate its image ever since. In just the past few years BASH TSA has grown to become a nationally renowned chapter.</p>

            <h3>State Representation</h3>

            <p>In <span class="color-red">1993</span>, Mark Schell from Boyertown served as student president of the state organization. It would take 23 years for the next Boyertown student president when Olivia Crocker was elected in <span class="color-red">2015</span>. Only two years later, Abigail Reigner was elected <span class="color-red">2018</span> state president. In the past five years, Boyertown students have held four student officer positions on the six-member board including Morgan Lepre as state reporter in <span class="color-red">2014</span> and Joshua Famous as state sergeant-at-arms in <span class="color-red">2018</span>.</p>

            <h3>Growth of the Program</h3>

            <p>Over the past ten years BASH TSA has grown from an average program to a nationally renowned competitor. This growth is evidenced in chapter logistics, competitive success, and community involvement.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6 nopadding">

            <h5>Membership</h5>

            <p>In the early 2000's, the membership of BASH TSA averaged between 6 and 10 students per year. From 2017 to 2019 BASH TSA has been the largest chapter in the state with between 60 and 100 students per year. This membership growth was so significant that we established a separate chapter, the Boyertown Freshman Academy, in 2018. 9th grade students instead compete and register with this group but remain equally involved in fundraising and charity activities.</p>

            <h5>Competitive Success</h5>

            <p>The difference in conference results between 2003 and 2019 effectively represents the scale of BASH TSA's growth. At the 2004 state conference, Boyertown captured only <span class="color-red">5 top ten placements and 0 trophies</span>. At the 2019 state conference, Boyertown captured <span class="color-blue">37 top ten placements and 12 trophies</span> - the most of any chapter in attendance. At the regional level, Boyertown had only <span class="color-red">6 placements</span> in 2004. In 2019 Boyertown had <span class="color-blue">79 placements</span> at the regional level - the most of any chapter by a wide margin.</p>

            <h5>Involvement</h5>

            <p>From 2002-2004, the only activity BASH TSA held was a hoagie fundraiser which didn't raise more than $50. At that point, however, the school district paid for a third of each student's competition at the state conference. Over the past few years students no longer receive any funding from the school. The ambitious fundraising program recently put in place has grown to involve more than six major annual fundraising/charity events. The spaghetti dinner and bag bingo events bring in between $2000 and $3000 each while the charity 5k in 2019 raised more than $6000.</p>

            <h5>Logistics</h5>

            <p>Over the past 10 years BASH TSA has set a national precedent for chapter operations. The chapter was recognized with the award for the most outstanding and involved chapter at the regional, state, and national level in 2019.</p>

            <p>In 2003, the chapter met twice each year, worked on events outside of school, and kept records using Microsoft Word and Excel. Since 2014 the chapter holds twice-weekly open labs, where students can use the technology education rooms at the school to work on their projects during after school hours from 3-6pm. A montly logistics meeting in the LGI - run by the chapter's student officer team - is mandatory for all members. This meeting covers the chapter's upcoming events and obligations for members. To prepare its ambitious program of work, the 12-member chapter officer team meets each week. There is also the option for TSA members to join the TSA flex - a free period built into the school day where they can work on TSA projects with their teammates.</p>

            <p>All of these work hours are made possible by the volunteer time of Joshua Pennington -  TSA advisor and a teacher at BASH. For the past few years Mr. Pennington has become involved as judging coordinator for the region 9 conference. Mr. Pennington was elected and is the incoming Board of Directors President for all of Pennsylvania TSA in 2019.</p>

            <p>Another key step in maintaining such a large and highly-functioning chapter is ChapterSweet. ChapterSweet is an online software program developed by BASH TSA alumni Joshua Famous to coordinate all chapter functions. Other chapters have since adopted this software tool. In 2019 BASH TSA sent its student officer team to the state Fall Leadership Experience to give a seminar sharing the chapter's highly effective fundraising and organizational strategies.</p>
