            <h3>Events</h3>

            <p>The main focus of TSA is its variety of competitive events. Over the course of the year, students will enter between 3 and 6 events either as individuals or as teams. The 44 events offered at the high school level range from <span class="color-blue">Biotechnology Design</span> to <span class="color-blue">Video Game Design</span>. Events like <span class="color-blue">Extemporaneous Speech</span> simply have students present on an impromptu topic while <span class="color-blue">Animatronics</span> has students build functional audioanimatronic displays. The full list of available events can be found <a href="https://tsaweb.org/competitions-programs/tsa/high-school-competitions">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Conferences</h3>

            <p>Throughout the year, competitors from BASH TSA represent the district at three main conferences. October through February is regional level competition. In early February, a few dozen schools gather to see who will advance to the state conference in April. Students who submit three quality projects and receive a top 3 ranking at the regional level are allowed to move on to the state conference, which involves hundreds of schools and more than a thousand students from across the state. Finally, in late June, BASH TSA sends the top students from the state confernece to the annual national conference in rotating locations. The national level of competition involves the top 8,000 students from 48 states and a handful of other countries and territories.

            <h3>Fundraising</h3>

            <p>With three major conferences and the need for relevant technology and materials, Boyertown TSA spends much of the year running a variety of fundraisers to help students fund their trips to the various conferences.</p>

            <h5>Spaghetti Dinner</h5>

            <p>One of the longest-running fundraisers at BASH TSA, the annual spaghetti dinner fundraiser offers a cheap meal that helps support the club's efforts. Run in conjunction with the winter choral concert, club members prepare and serve an all-you-can-eat meal of spaghetti, salad, and dessert for only $10.</p>

            <h5>Bag Bingo</h5>

            <p>The annual bag bingo fundraiser is a chance to get mothers and grandmothers out for a night of bingo fun to win high-end purses and home goods. A chinese auction, 50/50 game, and basket raffle all contribute to the fun of this community night which brings hundreds out to support BASH TSA year after year.</p>

            <h3>Charity Work</h3>

            <p>The area where we stand out most when compared to chapters across the nation is in our charity efforts. The American Cancer Society (ACS) is the national service project partner of national TSA, so fundraising for cancer research is a major focus of TSA chapters. BASH TSA currently holds the record for largest single-year ACS donation by a TSA chapter at $11,000. In addition to work with the ACS, the club pursues various other ways to assist the community.</p>

            <h5>Back to the 80's 5k Run/Walk</h5>

            <p>In 2019 BASH TSA held its first ever 5k run/walk in support of the ACS. The event was completely organized by the club's student officer team and brought out almost a hundred runners. More than a dozen sponsors (all local businesses) helped make the event a success and allowed a donation of more than $6,000.</p>

            <h5>Adopt-a-Child</h5>

            <p>Recently, BASH TSA started a collaboration with both the Boyertown Area Multiservice and Salvation Army called Adopt-a-Child. This program runs through early December and helps provide presents to underprivileged children in the community. Clubs throughout BASH all get a 'wishlist' of what a child wants for Christmas and are responsible for getting those items donated. Overall, this initiative makes a direct impact by improving the holiday season for less fortunate community members.</p>

            <h5>Pink-Out T-Shirts</h5>

            <p>This program is a collaboration between Boyertown TSA and the Student Council that raises funds for the ACS. On the Friday of spirit week each year, for the homecoming game, BASH TSA runs a 'pink-out'. The chapter designs, prints, and sells colored T-shirts all week and donates all proceeds to a certain kind of cancer research that rotates on a yearly basis.</p>

            <h5>Relay for Life</h5>

            <p>To help meet our ACS fundraising goals, the chapter sends a team to a local Relay for Life each year. These events are generally held at Moravian College or Millersville University. Chapter members enjoy walking laps, playing games, and meeting people during this 12 hour event.</p>

            <h5>Miracle Minute</h5>

            <p>As part of the state-level ACS fundraising efforts, BASH officers coordinated a miracle minute at our regional TSA conference. Over the course of a frantic minute, collectors ran around and collected small bills from the conference participants. In just 60 seconds BASH TSA members were able to raise more than $500 - the most of any region in the state.</p>
